The PDF reweighting tool computes the total pdf uncertainties for the user's observable (cross section, etc.). The procedure is based on the <a href="http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/pdf4lhc/PDF4LHC_practical_guide.pdf">PDF4LHC-guide<a/> / <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasProtected/TopPdfUncertainty">TopPdfUncertainty TWiki</a> and includes the computation of the inter- and intra-pdf uncertainties using <a href="http://lhapdf.hepforge.org/">LHAPDF</a>.<br />
RootCore is needed to compile the tool.

<h3>Installation:</h3>
<p>
This is a RootCore package and depends on RootCore itself and
LHAPDF6. In order to install it, you need to install (in this order).
<ol>
<li>Create a new directory:</li>
<pre>
  e.g.:
  mkdir packages
  cd packages
</li>
<li>Install RootCore</li>
<pre>
   Please follow the setup instrutions on this TWiki:
   
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/AtlasComputing/RootCore#Setting_up_RootCore
   
</pre>
<li>Install Asg_Boost, Asg_Lhapdf and PdfReweightingTool</li>
<pre>
  touch packages.txt
  echo "atlasoff/AsgExternal/Asg_Boost/tags" >> packages.txt
  echo "atlasoff/AsgExternal/Asg_Lhapdf/tags" >> packages.txt
  echo "atlasinst/Institutes/Humboldt/SingleTop/PdfReweightingTool/tags" >> packages.txt
  ./RootCore/scripts/checkout.sh packages.txt
  ./RootCore/scripts/find_packages.sh
</pre>
<li>Compile the tool</li>
<pre>
  ./RootCore/scripts/compile.sh
</pre>
</ol>
The shared library of the tool can be found in 'RootCore/lib/generic/'
</p>
<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>I can't compile the tool?</li>
<pre>
Please try the setup on lxplus. Start with a clean shell. Then type
these two commands:

setupATLAS
localSetupROOT

then follow the setup described above.  If this solves your problem,
check your shell variables. Don't define variables pointing to another
LHAPDF6 or boost install directory. This might confuse Asg_Lhapdf.

Please check the documenation of Asg_Lhapdf on how to use a different
LHADDF6 version.

If it still does not compile, sent me an email.
(Check the 'Changelog' for email contact.)
</pre>
<li>The compilation step was successful, but I can't find the shared library?</li>
<pre>
Do you use a recent RootCore version? In earlier versions of RootCore,
the shared libary was located in 'PdfReweightingTool/StandAlone/'.
</pre>
<li>The tool can't find any pdf set?</li>
<pre>
Please set the environment variable 'LHAPDF_DATA_PATH' to point to the
directory that hold the pdf sets (and make sure the directory contains
the pdf set you are looking for).
</pre>
<li>I would like to use different pdf sets. How can I change this?</li>
<pre>
The names of the pdf sets that are used, can be found in PdfSet::fgPdfNames (PdfSet.cxx).
</pre>
<li>How do I get the normalization scale factors needed for each sample?</li>
<pre>
If you don't have all events available (for example: if you used
skimmed ntuples), you need to have one normalization scale factor for
each sample.  These scale factors can be determined using the
PdfReweightingTool and the extra package 'PdfScripts' which is located
here:

atlasinst/Institutes/Humboldt/SingleTop/PdfScripts/tags

You need to run once over all events in each sample. The package above 
is a collection of scripts, that can be used to run the tool on the grid.
Please consult the 'README' for further info.
