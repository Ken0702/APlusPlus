#This is a documentation of the analysis steps of the t-/Wt channel analysis
#It is better to start every analysis step in your $LIBSINGLETOP/tasks folder to prevent errors

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Steps, which are to be done if you checked out the libSingleTop libary for the first time:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.1) Choose a machine of the cluster (dats1-8 or datm5-8) and create a user folder:
     e.g. "mkdir /rdsk/dats6/atlas/bilski"

     The log files and the run files will be written into this user folder.
   
I.2)
I.2.1) If the folder $LIBSINGLETOP/hist doesn't exist, create it.
I.2.2) If the folder $LIBSINGLETOP/tasks/elec and $LIBSINGLETOP/tasks/muon don't exist, create them.

I.3) Copy 
   'libAtlasAnalysis/utils/do_hfor_splitting.sh'
   to your ~/bin folder.

I.4) Change in 'CreateRetryBatchJobsSampleLists.sh' the line 
     
     "taskdir="/rdsk/dats6/atlas/"$user"/task_files/"$1"/"$2"Jet/""
     
     the dats6 to your machine of point 1).

I.5) Change in 'CallTaskMacro_tChannel.C' in the lines

     "const char* logfile_dir = "/rdsk/dats6/atlas/bilski/task_files/""
     "const char* histdir_mu  = "/users/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_mu/";"
     "const char* histdir_e   = "/users/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_e/";"

     the dats6 to your machine of point 1) and the user "bilski" to your username.

I.6) Change in 'WriteWhforFiles.C' the user "bilski" to your username in line
     
     "TString histdir = "/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_";"

I.7) Change in 'WriteAllSymmetrizedSystFiles.C' the user "bilski" to your username the line 
   
     "const char* histdir = "/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_";"
   
I.8) Change in 'CreateSystematicsPlotterMacros_tChannel.C' the lines

     "const char* plotdir_mu  = "/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_mu/";"
     "const char* plotdir_e   = "/eeh/bilski/atlas/APlusPlus/libSingleTop/hist/tChannelAnalysis_e/";"

     the user "bilski" to your username.

I.9) Include '$LIBSINGLETOP/tasks' in your binary path:

     export PATH=$LIBSINGLETOP/tasks:$PATH


I.10) Remark:
      The description is made for t-channel. Do it analogous for the Wt-channel files.
      For this, also change "tChannelAnalysis" to "WtChannelAnalysis" everywhere above!
      - The user name "bilski" is must be replaced by your user name (ruthh,strider,sstamm or something else).
      - Source of error: If a script doesn't work, please check the user path. Maybe something was forgotten in the above description.


# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Steps, which are to be done after every new MC production:
# ----------------------------------------------------------

II.1) Update the sample list "SampleListMC11c_as0Xb.txt" and add the paths of the new samples.

II.2) Update the sample list "SampleListMC11c_ms0Xb.txt" and add the paths of the new samples.

II.3) Split every  W+JetsLF and W+JetsHF sample to a HFOR folder one level down in the folder hierarchy.
      Check, if it hasn't been done already!!! Execute:
      
      'do_hfor_splitting.sh "SampleListMC_XXXX" "HFOR"'      

      The XXXX stands for 'ms0Xb' or 'as0Xb'. I depends on where the samples are located that you want to split.

      - Remark: It is faster to split the samples on one machine cluster (as0Xb or ms0Xb) and copy 
      the splitted files to the other cluster than splitting twice (it is very time-consuming!).
      There is a copy script available in 
      
      '$LIBATLASANALYSIS/utils/copy_HFOR_dirs.sh'

II.4)
II.4.1) Create the batch job task macros for the t-channel analysis in JetBin X for Leptonmode Y.

	root -l -b CallTaskMacro_tChannel.C;

II.4.2) Create the batch job task macros for the Wt-channel analysis in JetBin X for Leptonmode Y.
	
	root -l -b CallTaskMacro_Wt.C


# -------------------------
# Steps to run the analysis
# -------------------------

Remark: All scripts (*.sh) can be run without any argument to invoke the help function.
	Macros *.C are always run without arguments.

III.1) Update/compile your A++.

III.2) Change in "Atl_tChannelTask.C" (analogously for "Atl_WtChannelTask.C") in the function 

       "void Atl_tChannelTask::InitSelector()"

       the varaibles "n_jets_min" and "n_jets_max" to the jet bin, which you want to analyze.
       Both variables have to be the same to analyze this exclusive jet bin.

III.3) Delete/move your root files in $LIBSINGLETOP/hist/tChannelAnalysis_e (also for mu and Wt, if it applies)
       of the analysis, which you want to start.

III.4) Start the analysis for the first time for your channel/lepton/jetbin/cluster;

       e.g. "root -l task_tChannelAnalysis_e_2Jets_as0Xb.C"

       Choose your job(s) and click "Execute Task". If you use the ADVICE (see below), start the task macro with 

       e.g. "root -l -b " and use the command "analysis->ExecuteTask()".

III.5) If all jobs are submitted and done on the cluster (check the queue status in the shell with the command  "qstat")
       You might have to repeat some submissions since some jobs failed.
       
       - Delete all retry sample lists via
         "rm SampleListRetry*".

       - Execute
         "./CreateRetryBatchJobsSampleLists.sh lepton jetbin cluster channel" (see input arguments in the script).

       - Create retry task macros from the retry sample lists by opening root via
       
         "root -l -b"

         and then loading the retry task macro via 
	 ".L CreateRetryTaskMacro_tChannel.C"

      	 and then (see documentation of CreateRetryTaskMacro_tChannel.C) executing the retry task macro for example as
	 "CreateRetryTaskMacro("SampleListRetry","task_tChannelAnalysis_retry.C",
	                       "$LIBSINGLETOP/hist/tChannelAnalysis_e/",
                               "/rdsk/datm8/atlas/ruthh/task_files/",
                               "Atl_tChannelTask_e","as0Xb",k2Jets,kOff,kTight)"

         where "ruthh" should be replaced by your own username and datm8 by your machine of point 1)
	 at the very top of this manual.

       - Start the created retry macro then via 
         "root -l task_tChannelAnalysisRetry_e_2Jets_as0Xb.C"

	 Use the created retry macro!
	 If you use the ADVICE (see below), start the task macro with 
	 "root -l -b " and use the command "analysis->ExecuteTask()".

       - Repeat all steps of point 5), until after calling 
         "./CreateRetryBatchJobsSampleLists.sh lepton jetbin cluster channel"

	 no new retry samples lists are created anymore.

III.6) Merge the ttbar files (use screen)
      
       "./MergeTTbarFilesForPlotter.sh lepton jetbin channel"

III.7) Merge W+Jets files (use screen)

       "root -l -b WriteAllWhforFiles.C"

III.7.1) If you have not done all systematics, you only need to merge the one you produced.
	 Look up the enum-number in "WriteWhforFiles.C" enums start with 0!
	 0 = nominal, 1 = kElScaledUp ...

III.8) Copy some ttbar files for other systematics

      "./MergeTTbarFilesForPlotter-After.sh lepton jetbin channel" 

III.9) Ensure that all symmetriezed files are at the correct palce. Do

       "root -l -b WriteAllSymmetrizedSystFiles.C"

III.9.1) If you have not run all systematics (~30), you have to look-up the enum number corresponding
 	 to the systematic you want to produce. (e.g. 4 = ISRFSR)
	 The enum can be found in "WriteSymmetrizedSystFiles.C", look for SystMode. enum starts with 0!

III.10) You have to repeat 1) to 9) for all lepton modes, jetbins and production channels, which you want to analyze.


# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Steps to create the stacked plots with the MCPlotter functionality:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
      
IV.1) Duplicate QCD files for all systematics. Run 
      
      "./DuplicateDataQCDFilesForPlotter.sh lepton jetbin channel"

      They only exist for the nominal case. It is important for the stacked plots to have qcd and data in them at all.

IV.2) Create the plotter macros for all systematics

      "root -l -b CreateSystematicsPlotterMacros_tChannel.C"

IV.2.1) W SA tool mode: 1 (for 7 TeV if not otherwise specified)

IV.3) Send all the plotter jobs to the batch cluster at once (!).

      "./SendMCPlotterTasks.sh lepton jetbin tagmode channel"

IV.4) Necessarry for using BILL:
      By calling 

      "./CreateAdditionalSystFolders.sh lepton jetbin channel"

      the systematics of W normalization and others that lie within the nominal folder still
      are raised to the same level as the other plotter files and corresponding folders are created for them.

      The command 
      
      "./Link_X_LeptonSystematics.sh channel jetbin"

      links the systematics, which don't exist for a particular lepton mode, to the nominal folder.

IV.5) You must repeat 1) to 4) for all lepton modes, jetbins and production channels, which you want to analyze.


#
# The next analysis step is BILL. For more informations see the documentation in $BILLHOME
# Have fun with analyzing!!! :) 
#      
	     

ADVICE: A very easy but useful tool is "screen". It is a ghost shell, which you can discard without
	closing the sessions. It is optimal for scripts, which use a lot of time, for 
	example the "do_hfor_splitting" or submitting of the analysis jobs with the task macros.
	The important thing is to start the scripts with suppressed graphical interface
	
	(root -l -b ...). 
	
	Important key commands for screen:
	- "screen": starts a session in screen mode.

	- "CTRL+a" -> "d": discard the screen session.
	  If you started screen on a HU machine, you can after CTRL+a->d shut down your personal computer.

	- "screen -r": resumes the screen session.
	  You have to remember, on which machine you started the screen session in order to be able to retrieve it!!!

	- "exit": the exit-command in the screen session terminates the screen session!
          You must terminate unused sessions, otherwise you have to choose between different
	  open screen sessions when doing "screen -r"!!!
